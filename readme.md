# NFL Bracket Challenge #

This project was created to run a bracket challenge among friends. Users must sign up and submit a bracket. It utilizes PHP, bootstrap and just plain HTML, CSS, & JavaScript (w/ jQuery). The bracket styles are copied from SB Nation.

This project was used over the course of a few years, there are some legacy portions still remaining in the codebase. 

I have plans to port this over to a node-react stack and potentially open up as an open-source project.

**Rules:** 10$ buy-in, winner-takes-all.

**Scoring:** Each team that you guess correctly as making it through to the next round will award you with the following point amounts.

* Wildcard Games: **1pt**
* Divisional Round: **2pts**
* Championship Round: **5pts**
* Superbowl: **10pts**


* Tiebreaker: Superbowl Score
* 2nd Tiebreaker: Superbowl MVP
